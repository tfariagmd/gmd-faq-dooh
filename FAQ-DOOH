            <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">What is Digital Out-of-Home (DOOH)?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Digital Out-of-Home (DOOH) refers to digital advertising displays or screens placed in public locations. These screens are typically found in areas with high foot traffic, such as shopping malls, airports, transit stations, billboards, and sports stadiums. DOOH allows advertisers to display dynamic and engaging content, reaching a wide audience in various locations.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-section">
            <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">How does DOOH work?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">DOOH works by utilizing digital screens and a content management system. Advertisers create and schedule their ad content using digital signage software or platforms. This content is then displayed on the digital screens, providing opportunities for targeted advertising, real-time updates, and interactive experiences. Some DOOH platforms also leverage programmatic advertising, allowing automated buying and selling of ad space in real time.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-section">
            <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">What are the benefits of DOOH advertising?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">DOOH advertising offers several benefits. It provides a wide audience reach, allowing advertisers to target specific demographics or locations effectively. The dynamic nature of DOOH content captures attention and engagement. </div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-section">
            <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Where can DOOH be found?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">DOOH screens can be found in various public locations. Common examples include shopping malls, airports, bus and train stations, roadside billboards, sports arenas, and even inside taxis or rideshare vehicles. DOOH networks are continually expanding and evolving, providing opportunities for advertisers to engage with their audience in new and innovative ways.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-section">
            <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">How does the system count impressions or plays?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">The numbers are verified by COMMB (Canadian Out Of Home Marketing & Measurement Bureau). However, it is challenging to accurately forecast the conversion of one play to a specific number of impressions. This is because each media owner determines their own impression multipliers based on factors such as screen location, time of day, day of the week, venue type, and seasonal forecasts.

For instance, the impression multiplier for a billboard in downtown Toronto will likely be higher compared to a billboard in rural Saskatchewan due to differences in population density and viewer engagement. These variations in location-specific factors contribute to the different impression multipliers set by media owners.

        <div class="faq-section">
            <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Is there any link where I can check the screens available on the platform?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Absolutely. You can access our Digital Out-of-Home screens through this link.

This list is typically updated monthly.

If you're interested in filtering by location, venue types, and more, we highly recommend downloading the list or making a copy. This way, you'll have the flexibility to create any filter that suits your needs. This enables you to find the screens that align with your campaign requirements easily.

        <div class="faq-section">
            <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Can we guarantee the number of impressions will be served on specific screens?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee this as it depends on the availability of inventory during the campaign period. It's important to remember that we sell remnant inventory that these media owners have, so we cannot guarantee the exact amount of inventory available since we don't have direct access to it. However, we'll do our best to work with the available inventory and optimize your campaign for success.

In the programmatic advertising ecosystem, the inventory available for purchase is typically considered as a "remnant" inventory. This is because programmatic ads are served on ad space owned by publishers or media owners. As a buyer, we don't have direct control or awareness of the decisions made by the media owners regarding their inventory. For example, a media owner may choose to temporarily remove a screen from a digital out-of-home (DOOH) network for a period of time due to direct sales commitments they have made. Such decisions made by media owners can have an impact on our programmatic campaigns.
Similarly, if one of our direct clients buys a site takeover on a specific website, it means that other advertisers, often referred to as "remnant advertisers," will not be able to appear on that site during the period of the site takeover. 
</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-section">
            <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Can we have direct access to the media owner inventory?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Unfortunately, we cannot. It's similar to Whitelisting certain websites in Programmatic Display. While we are able to focus on selected screens, since we are not buying the inventory directly from the publisher/media owner, we aren't able to guarantee a specific number of impressions of individual screens.
Our DOOH product gives us the ability to access a wide variety of screens with our clients' ads, but since it's a programmatic product, we don't have the ability to book direct campaigns with individual media owners.
In the same way that we're not able to book campaigns directly on websites that Glacier doesn't own (or have a partnership with) -- such as CBC or TSN -- but our clients' ads are able to appear on these sites.
</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-section">
            <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Can a DOOH campaign run ads in Gambling, Cannabis, alcohol, medical/addiction, etc.?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">When it comes to DOOH campaigns related to topics such as gambling, cannabis, alcohol, medical/addiction, etc., they generally receive approval from the majority of media owners. However, in order to provide more specific information, we would require a general overview of where you intend to run these ads. Therefore, if you place an order, please provide us with additional details such as total impressions/budget, specific locations, screens, their websites, and so on. This will enable us to assist you more effectively.
It's important to note that certain restrictions apply, such as avoiding ad placements within close proximity to schools or daycare facilities. Similarly, we need to review the sensitivity of displaying creatives promoting abortion clinics, taking into account political contexts and geographical considerations for each screen.
</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-section">
            <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Can we stand in front of a screen hoping to see the ads?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">No, standing in front of a screen hoping to see specific ads is not an effective or reliable method. Digital out-of-home (DOOH) advertising is designed to reach a broader audience in public spaces rather than targeting individuals directly. The ads displayed on screens are typically delivered based on pre-determined schedules, algorithms, and targeting parameters set by the advertisers and media owners.

Attempting to view specific ads by standing in front of a screen may not yield the desired results, as the ads may rotate or change based on various factors such as time of day, location, and targeted audience segments. It's best to engage with DOOH ads as part of your regular activities in public spaces, rather than relying on personal attempts to view specific content.

        </div>
        <div class="faq-section">
            <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Can the client have ads in languages other than English?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">It is possible to run ads in languages other than English. However, it is important to check which screens/media owners accept different languages. Some screens may have restrictions or preferences when it comes to the languages they can accommodate.
For instance, certain screens may only accept ads in French, while others may support multiple languages or have no language restrictions at all.  

Checking the language requirements and policies of each screen will help ensure that your ads are displayed accurately and effectively to the target audience.

        <div class="faq-section">
            <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">What type of reporting is available?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Monthly reports are typically posted in the Mavenlink project within the first seven business days of the following month.
If you require a report with a specific date range, kindly contact the DOOH team. Please note that we would appreciate a minimum of 5 hours to process and work on the report to ensure its accuracy and quality.
</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-section">
            <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Can the client choose specific venue types like billboards, etc?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">The client has the flexibility to choose specific venue types for their campaign. However, it is generally recommended to select a broader range of screens and venue types to minimize pacing issues. By opting for a diverse selection of screens and venue types, the campaign can achieve a more balanced and consistent distribution of impressions over time. This approach helps to avoid potential pacing challenges that may arise if the campaign is limited to a narrow set of screens or venue types. By considering a wider range of options, the campaign can benefit from increased reach and better overall performance.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-section">
            <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Is there any minimum budget for the DOOH campaigns? If yes, what is that budget?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">The minimum budget requirement for the DOOH campaign is a monthly buy of $1000.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-section">
            <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">How long do the ads appear on the screen?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">The duration of ads appearing on screens in a DOOH campaign can vary from screen to screen. On average, ads tend to have a duration of 6 to 15 seconds per play. However, it's important to note that the specific duration can differ based on the screen, location, media owner, and other factors.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-section">
            <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">The client wants to serve their ads in the US. Is that possible?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Absolutely! DOOH campaigns can be launched in various countries, including the US, Australia, and many more. If you would like more information about launching a campaign in specific countries or regions, please don't hesitate to reach out to our DOOH team. </div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-section">
            <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">The client is requesting screenshots for the DOOH campaigns. Can we have it?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Unfortunately, screenshots are not available in the DOOH, as they involve displaying ads on physical screens in public spaces. Similarly in our Programmatic Audio campaigns, we are not able to provide any screenshots.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-section">
            <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Can we use keywords in the DOOH campaigns?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">The DOOH campaigns operate differently from display programmatic campaigns. HiveStack does not provide the option to add keywords to the campaign.
Unlike display programmatic campaigns that utilize keywords for contextual targeting, DOOH campaigns typically rely on factors such as location, demographics, time of day, and specific venues to target the desired audience. The targeting options and capabilities in DOOH campaigns may differ from those in traditional digital advertising platforms.
</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-section">
            <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">The client is requesting more details about the locations of the screens. Is that possible?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">No, that’s not possible. The details in the screen list are all the details we received from the media owner.
If the screen is called “YVR airport lounge”, we are not able to tell you the exact positioning of the screen in the lounge. 
</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-section">
            <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Can we receive the ad sizes before sending any information about the campaign?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">We have the most common sizes in a number of locations: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13xLbywDKVGzvBSmI7dJr5gyaewf3e5Hg2Z-NMrRMAT0/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.yo6o6wi8yqn">DOOH - Screens by Market</a> 
However, since screen sizes vary based on the location & screens selected, for campaigns that have different targeting,  we kindly request that you share all the relevant targeting details with us. Once we have a clear understanding of your campaign requirements & desired targeting, we can send the ad sizes that will be needed for the campaign.

Also, If the client is looking to target multiple cities, and each city requires a different creative, it would be helpful to know this information before sending out the creative sizes. You see, each location has its own specific size requirements, and if we receive the creatives separately for each city without prior knowledge, we might have to ask you for extra sizes. It's important to consider that DOOH campaigns work a bit differently from Local Display and Programmatic Display. In those types of campaigns, the ad sizes are always the same, but with DOOH, the ad sizes vary depending on the location, screens, and venue types.
</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-section">
            <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Can we change the location or add new locations during the campaign? Or even add an extra venue type?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Absolutely, changes can be made during the campaign. But it's important to keep in mind that adding new locations or screens may require additional ad sizes to effectively serve impressions. It's essential to consider the specific requirements of the new locations or screens and ensure that the ad sizes are compatible with their display capabilities.</div>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-section">
            <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">Which clients or categories of clients advertise based on the weather targeting option?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Here are some verticals that we can use for weather targets.
</p>
<strong>Retailers:</strong> Retailers, such as clothing stores, shoe stores, or department stores, can use weather targeting in DOOH campaigns to promote products that are relevant to the current weather conditions. For instance, a retailer may display advertisements for raincoats and umbrellas when it's raining or promote summer clothing and accessories during warm weather.
</p>
<strong>Restaurants and Cafes:</strong> Food establishments can leverage weather targeting to advertise specific menu items based on weather conditions. For example, a coffee shop might promote hot beverages during colder months or refreshing iced drinks on hot summer days.
</p>
<strong>Travel and Tourism:</strong> Companies in the travel and tourism industry, including hotels, resorts, and tourist attractions, can utilize weather targeting to entice potential visitors. They may display advertisements showcasing sunny beach destinations during winter months or advertise indoor activities during rainy periods.
</p>
<strong>Automotive:</strong> Automotive brands or dealerships can tailor their DOOH campaigns based on weather targeting. For instance, they might highlight the features of four-wheel-drive vehicles during snowy or icy weather or promote convertible cars during sunny periods.
</p>
<strong>Outdoor Activities and Events:</strong> Companies organizing outdoor activities, such as music festivals, sports events, or adventure tours, can benefit from weather targeting. They can display advertisements promoting upcoming events when the weather is expected to be favourable for outdoor participation.
</p>
<strong>Health and Wellness:</strong> Fitness centers, gyms, or yoga studios can leverage weather targeting to encourage potential customers to engage in indoor activities during extreme weather conditions. They may highlight the benefits of indoor workouts during scorching heat or freezing temperatures.
</p>
Of course, the effectiveness and suitability of weather targeting will depend on each client's specific goals, target audience, and offerings.

        <div class="faq-section">
            <div class="faq-question" onclick="toggleAnswer(this)">How does geofencing work with this product?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">Similar to programmatic display, we are able to include virtual geofences in a campaign, where we will focus impressions on users whose devices have been previously tracked & collected within a set physical location. However, since a single play includes multiple impressions based on expected traffic around a screen when the client’s ad is shown, it is likely that even within the geofencing tactic, some impressions will be served to users who were not necessarily in one of the selected geofences. For instance, if we're tracking individuals entering the GMD office and then serving impressions wherever they are in BC, consider this scenario: I visited the GMD office and later went to a mall during my lunch break, where I entered an elevator with a screen. The system would recognize me as part of the desired audience and try to serve me the ad. However, there could be other people on the elevator who were not in the GMD office, and they would also be counted as impressions.
This highlights the distinction between Programmatic Display and DOOH. In Programmatic Display, impressions are exclusively delivered to individuals who have been in a geofence. This precision is achievable in programmatic display because impressions are directed to the specific user’s device.
Note that we are not able to report on conversion zones for DOOH.
